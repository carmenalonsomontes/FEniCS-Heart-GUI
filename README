Graphical User Interface to automate the pipeline for Heart simulation using FEniCS

1. Motivation

This GUI is intended to help in the automation of the script generation for the heart simulation used by the research group at KTH. 
It is still in early versions, with very few functionality available, but with the basics.


2. Implemented features
Date: Novemeber 2016
+ Automatic generation of execution and launch scripts to be connected with cluster and based on user information
+ Automatic generation of clinical file with the relevant information of patients
+ Easing the parameter selection for dyastole/syastole per each patient in a study
